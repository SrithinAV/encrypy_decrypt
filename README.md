# encrypy_decrypt
This is a C Plus Plus program to encrypt a text file and decrypt a text file.
The program starts with a 9 different kinds of option to the user, They are:
1. Write[encrypt]: Which is used to write by encrypting each character. The encryption is done by the default key which is defined in the program.
2. Read [decrypt]: Which is used to read by decrypting each character. The decryption is done by the default key which is defined in the program.
3. Encrypt a text file: Which is used to encrypt a text file that exist already in the current directory. Encryption is done by the defalut key.
4. Decrypt a txt file: Which is used to decrypt a text file that exist already in the current directory. Decryption is done by the default key.
5. Encrypt by external key: Which is used to encrypt a text file using a user defined key.characters are inputed through the console and not from a txt file.
6. Decrypt by external key: Which is used to decrypt a text file using the same key that is used for encryption.
7. Encrypt by external key, read from file:  Which is used to encrypt a text file using a user defined key.characters are readed from a text file and saves as the encrypted file with a file name "inputed filename"+"encrypted.txt".
8. Decrypt by external key,Saves as text file: Which is used to decrypt a text file using the same key used to ecncrypt the file. decrypted file is saved as the "inputed filename + encrypted + decrypted.txt".
9. Key generator: A new key is generated by the program which can be used to encrypt and decrypt the files.



**********************************points to note**********************************
User need not want to input the file extension for example, srithin.txt can be simply inputed as srithin.
Always make sure that the key name is not already existed in the directory while generating a new key.
If you are creating your own key without a key generator, always make sure that all characters are included and characters are writtern in a single line.
The key text file should contain only one single line which should be at the top or at the beginnig of the txt file.
